#### Guidance ####

***Identifier***

When to use Practitioner.identifier vs PractitionerRole.identifier:

It is suggested that Practitioner.identifier is used for identifiers that are recognised by Royal Colleges (for example a General Medical Council (GMC) Code), and PractitionerRole.identifier is used for the identification of a Practitioner working for an Organisation (such as a SmartCard identifier).

***Identifier.system***

The following identifier system uri's should be used where official identifiers are being used:

Organization | URI
--- | --- 
General Medical Council (GMC) | https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/Id/gmc-number
Nurse & Midwifery Council (NMC) | https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/Id/nmc-number
Health & Care Profession Council | https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/Id/hcpc-number
